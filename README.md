### Starting point:
[Guidance by multiple sheepdogs including abnormalities](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10015-022-00807-1)


### Sketch
First, we will find more documentation and articles about this modelisation to have a good overview of the topic.
Then we will come up with a more detailled plan in order to acheive the milestones.

In parallel, we will search for the best way to implement the model on our computers.

For the first report, we expect to have a clear methodology, a repartion of roles within the group and a first choice of implementation

In the weeks after we will recreate the model and expect to acheive a model that includes the first three steps of the following plan. 
We will test this first model in order to create a baseline before adding abnormalities.

Plan to recreate the model in steps :
- First model only the sheep herd.
- Then adding one dog
- Then adding multiple dogs
- Then adding abnormalities

The first modelisations will have a low number of sheep and dog.

Expected results :
- Multiple dogs are more efficient than one because it spreads around the flock

We would like to have the first model and baseline for the second report.
Then we will add abnormalities and MSR algorithm in order to compare the results with our baseline.

Expected results :
- MSR algorithm can help mainting the formation in presence of abnormal dog behaviour
- Many abnormalities reduce the performance


With the time remaining before the final report delivery we could try to improve the model by adding one of the possible improvements from the list below.

Possible improvements of the model :
- Transforming dog vision into real vision with obstacles
- Adapt the repulsion force between dogs in function of the flock density
- Adding energy costs and stamina to the dogs
